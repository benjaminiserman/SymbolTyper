SymbolTyper is an app that allows the typing of complex symbols on a regular keyboard. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [You use a **Windows** machine supported by .NET 7](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/7.0/supported-os.md)
- You **do not** need to have .NET 7 installed
- You have downloaded the file "standalone.zip" from the latest release

## Installation

1. Download "standalone.zip" from the latest release, depending on your prerequisites.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Find the file "SymbolTyper.exe" within the unzipped folder and run it.

## Usage

The SymbolTyper app will now appear on your system tray, where it can be toggled by either clicking it or by pressing your SymbolTyper toggle key combo, as defined in the configuration (default: ALT + S). 

To use SymbolTyper, type one of the keystrings as specified in the config (for example, "\pi"). After pressing space, the symbol ùúã will be entered.

To change the strings and symbols supported by SymbolTyper, edit your SymbolTyper config.json file. After restarting the program, your changes will be applied.
